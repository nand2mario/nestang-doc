For the changes of NESTang over time, see [changes.md](https://github.com/nand2mario/nestang/blob/master/CHANGES.md).

Here are what I may work on when I get time. No promise though.

* Saves and loads.
* Cheats support.
* Support more games.
* Make an enclosure design.
* Sipeed is making a 138K-LUT Tang board. Consider porting more cores to it when it comes out.

Please <a href="https://github.com/nand2mario/nestang/issues">file and issue</a> or <a href="email:nand2mario@outlook.com">drop me a note</a> if you have any suggestion. A <a href="https://github.com/nand2mario/nestang/pulls">pull request</a> is even better.
